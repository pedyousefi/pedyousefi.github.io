# About me...
I'm Pedram. I recently graduated with a Master's degree from Istanbul Technical University. This is my personal webpage, where you can find my education and research details, as well as my CV and contact information. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and a Master's degree in Telecommunications. My primary research areas include machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition. During my Master's studies, I focused on image and video processing, specifically working with CNN networks to detect and count target objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, or bicycles in input frames. My work involved estimating crowd numbers and distribution patterns through color-coded density maps, both in spatial and temporal domains.
