# About me...
I'm Pedram. I recently graduated with a Master's degree from Istanbul Technical University. This is my personal webpage, where you can find my education and research details, as well as my CV, publications and contact information. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and a Master's degree in Telecommunications. I have experience working in two main research areas. My primary research areas include machine learning, computer vision, and pattern recognition. During my Master's studies, I focused on image and video processing, specifically working with CNN networks to detect and count target objects such as pedestrians, vehicles, or bicycles in input frames. My work involved estimating crowd numbers and distribution patterns through color-coded density maps in both spatial and temporal domains. I published an IEEE paper in this area, and the link to the publication can be found on this webpage. My second area of expertise is networking and telecommunications, specifically the use of machine learning techniques for network quality assessment and management. I detailed my work on 5G network quality of experience (QoE).
